/*
* Task: 
*	Input: 2 sorted arrays of size 8. The arrays must have unique members (though duplicates in the different arrays are allowed)
*		and must not have 0 as an element.
*	Output: an array of size 16 which combines the 2 sorted arrays into a single array which is also sorted. If there are any duplicate
*		elements, the duplicate element is only written in the array once. The array is padded with 0s if its total number of
*		elements is less than 16.
* Approach:
*	Create separate indexes with which you will iterate your two arrays. Iterate the two arrays at the same time (in one loop statement).
	Copy the current smaller member of the arrays and increase the coresponding index. If the elements are equal, copy the element
	only once but increase both indexes to skip the duplicate.
*	Once you've exited your loop, one of the arrays must have finished. You do not need to check which one it is - simply try to
*	iterate both until they're done. Since one of them has been traversed in full, its index would have reached the position (size - 1)
*	and it would simply not enter any loop statement intended to traverse it further.
* Notes:
*	The algorithm is explained in full in the problem task

/*
*  Task:
*	Input: a stream of positive integers that ends when a negative number is entered
*	Output: the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the entered positive numbers
*  Approach:
*	We use the fact that GCD(a, b, c) = GCD(a, GCD(b, c)). Set the GCD to initially be the first entered number.
*	After that, make the new GCD the GCD of the newly inputted number and the old GCD.
*	Repeat until a negative digit is entered (while loop).
*	To calculate the GCD of two numbers, we use Euclid's algorithm
